# NixOS Logo Mounted Shelfmount

This is a basic design for a NixOS logo and fits on the post slots for some shelving I have.

## Steps to printing.

1. Find colors you want for the individual Lambdas (I picked pastel pink and lavender)
  - Print this facing down to avoid supports and add that beautiful first layer to the face.

2. Print the backpanel and post insert.
  - Print them together. Post having wide face down, and the panel face down. No supports needed.

4. Insert lambdas in the order corresponding to the NixOS logo
5. Insert Post into back of panel.

No glue required as these are tight fits.
